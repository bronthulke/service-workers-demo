# Service Workers Demo
A simple demo of service workers, including the use of the cache, push and notification APIs.

This demo supports my talk on Service Workers (a WIP following my lightening talk at DDD by Nights!).

In order for the service worker to function, you'll need to run this at http://localhost or host it somewhere that it can be served up over HTTPS (e.g. Github pages).

See it in action here: https://bronthulke.github.io/service-workers-demo/
